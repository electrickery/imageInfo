    <h2>Teensy / Arduino based Floppy Drive tester</h2>

    <p>This project is meant as a replacement of my old <a href="/comp/divcomp/20xx.html">BASF 20XX disk exerciser<a>.
     It has all the switches, blinking lights and numbers, but limited in its use. But it has some nice features which
     will find their way in this new solution.

    <p>The current solution uses a <a href="">Teensy 3.2</a>, but the current functionality would fit in any Arduino
     with ten I/O pins available.

   <p>Plans are:<ul>
    <li>add exercise features from the 20XX, 
    <li>add colorful blinking lights,
    <li>restructuring command set,
    <li>optionally attempt to read the data signal, and export the result as flux-transition timings per track. 
     The format would be similar to that of the CatWeasel or DiscFerret.
   </ul>
   But it might as well never happen. Plenty of other projects. This was about a day work, including this doc.

   <p>Versions:
   <ul>
       <li><a href="FDDExer01.ino">Version 0.1</a> first version. 
   </ul>

   <p>No documentation yet, but the pin-layout is in the source, and the floppy connector is a standard.

<p>Command set:
<pre>
DI[01], Direction in or out
DS[01], Drive Select on or off
Hx[01], Head Load off or on
I       List input signals and current track
M[01],  Motor off or on
R,      Reset all signals (to 1)
SKnn,   Seek track (always two decimal digits)
SS[01], Side Select 0 or 1
STnn,   Execute steps (always two decimal digits)
?       Short help
</pre>
   
   <p>The FDDexer Arduino sketch is released under the 3-clause BSD license. So instead of asking me to add a
    feature, you could add it yourself :-).
