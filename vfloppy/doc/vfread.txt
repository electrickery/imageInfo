Vfread reads the directory or a file from a vfloppy image.

usage: vfread <imageName> [<fileName>]

The image must be a valid vfloppy disk image. If not vfread complains
about 'corrupt directory entries, and very probably can't find the
specified file. Not much robustness testing is done.

The specified file name can be upper of lower case, it is converted
CP/M standard upper case. The total length is truncated to eleven
characters (excluding an optional dot), and the extension (what's
behind the dot) to three. I did some testing on this part.
