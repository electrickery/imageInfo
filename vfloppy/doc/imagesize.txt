The vfloppy image as generated by the original vformat (format in the
original package) and used by epspd and the vman utilities has two 
drawbacks:
- It is way to big - 524288 bytes (128 blocks of 4096 bytes) while the 
  CPM uses only 284672 bytes (139 allocation blocks of 2048 bytes).
- It omits the first four sectors for system data. No problem for
  PX4/8 usage as these machines never boot from the image, but a
  problem if HX-20 support is needed. With these sectors added, the
  image maps one to one to a real TF-20 disk.

This will be solved in two steps: 
- The new vformat will produce 284672 byte sized images. This is
  still compatible with epspd and the vfman utilities (the extra
  space is ignored, as the maximum size is hard coded via vf.h).
- When HX-20 support is added, a new vformat size will be
  introduced and both the 524288 and 284672 formats will be
  converted by epspd and vfwrite to the new format.
