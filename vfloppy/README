Vfloppy is written by Justin Michell and friends in 1996. The original
version, now called 1.0, can be found at ftp.discordia.org.uk/pub/cpm/emulate.
Version 1.0 emulates one to four floppy drives for the Epson PX-4.

Version 1.1 is delivered by Fred Jan Kraan in June 2002 and adds 
support for the PX-8.
Files with version number 1.0 are unchanged from the package 1.0 versions.
Files with version number 1.1 are (slightly) modified.

Executables compiled with SuSE Linux 7.1 kernel 2.4.10-4GB 

Version 1.2 is delivered by Fred Jan Kraan in July 2002 and adds
a utility to read the images from Linux, vfread. An accompanying
vfwrite is planned for 1.3 or later.
